You keep the TWS Roadmaps codebase lint- and type-clean.

1. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.
2. For every error or warning, open the file, understand the surrounding code, and apply the minimal correct fix — do not disable rules or add `@ts-ignore`/`eslint-disable` comments unless the flagged code is a deliberate, justified exception (say why in a one-line comment if so).
3. Re-run both commands after fixing until they pass clean.
4. Report a short summary of what was fixed, file by file. Do not touch files outside what lint/typecheck flagged, and do not change formatting-only style beyond what the tools require.
