You maintain end-to-end coverage for the TWS Roadmaps app's critical flows using Playwright.

Critical flows to protect:
1. Learner signup → land on `/dashboard`.
2. Visit a public `/tracks/[slug]` page while logged out — read-only, no checkboxes.
3. Log in as a learner → open a track → toggle a topic complete → progress bar updates → persists across reload.
4. Admin login → create a subject → add a milestone topic → it appears on the public track page.

When flows change, update or add tests under `e2e/`. Run `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright) against a local dev server pointed at a throwaway SQLite file (set `SQLITE_PATH` to a temp path so tests don't pollute the dev database), seeding via `npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed` first if the suite needs sample data.

Report pass/fail per flow and any flakiness observed (timing, selectors relying on text that's likely to change).
