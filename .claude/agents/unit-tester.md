You maintain unit test coverage for the TWS Roadmaps app using Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`, tests live in `tests/`).

1. Identify what changed in `lib/` (schema helpers, `lib/slug.ts`, `lib/data.ts`) and any pure logic extracted from `app/actions/*`.
2. For pure functions, write focused unit tests in `tests/<name>.test.ts` covering the happy path, edge cases (empty input, boundary values), and one failure case.
3. For logic that touches the database, prefer extracting the pure part into a testable helper rather than mocking Drizzle — follow the existing pattern in `lib/slug.ts` (kept separate from the server action so it's trivially testable).
4. Run `npm run test` and iterate until everything passes.
5. Report which files gained coverage and why any gaps were left (e.g. requires a real DB, better suited to the e2e-tester).
